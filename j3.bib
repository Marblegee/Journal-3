	abstract = {Recent advances in chromosome conformation capture technologies have led to the discovery of previously unappreciated structural features of chromatin. Computational analysis has been critical in detecting these features and thereby helping to uncover the building blocks of genome architecture. Algorithms are being developed to integrate these architectural features to construct better three-dimensional (3D) models of the genome. These computational methods have revealed the importance of 3D genome organization to essential biological processes. In this article, we review the state of the art in analytic and modeling techniques with a focus on their application to answering various biological questions related to chromatin structure. We summarize the limitations of these computational techniques and suggest future directions, including the importance of incorporating multiple sources of experimental data in building a more comprehensive model of the genome.

Integrating with different datasets, it can also be applied to studying various biological questions, such as nuclear organization, gene transcription regulation, spatiotemporal development, genome assembly, and cancer genomics. During the last decade, the development and application of Hi-C have dramatically changed the view of genome architecture, chromatin conformation, and gene interaction. So far, Hi-C-related studies remain vivacious and controversial; thus, a unified standard of library construction and bioinformatics analysis are urgently needed. In this review, we have summarized its history, development, methodologies, advances, applications, shortages, and future perspectives. We discuss a few limitations of the current Hi-C technologies and future directions for improvement and highlight how Hi-C can bridge 3D structure to gene function. This review will be helpful for scientists who want to engage in the 3D genomics field; it also shows some future tracks.},

This has been primarily due to the development of high-throughput, next-generation chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies, which have provided next-generation sequencing data about chromosome conformations in order to map the 3-D genome structure. The introduction of the Hi-C technique—a variant of the 3C method—has allowed researchers to extract the interaction frequency (IF) for all loci of a genome at high-throughput and at a genome-wide scale. In this review we describe, categorize, and compare the various methods developed to map chromosome and genome structures from 3C data—particularly Hi-C data. We summarize the improvements introduced by these methods, describe the approach used for method evaluation, and discuss how these advancements shape the future of genome structure construction.},

Different techniques have been developed and applied to uncover the intrinsic mechanism of genome architecture, especially the chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C-derived methods. 3C and 3C-derived techniques provide us approaches to perform high-throughput chromatin architecture assays at the genome scale. However, the advantage and disadvantage of current methodologies of C-technologies have not been discussed extensively. In this review, we described and compared the methodologies of C-technologies used in genome organization studies with an emphasis on Hi-C method. We also discussed the crucial challenges facing current genome architecture studies based on 3C and 3C-derived technologies and the direction of future technologies to address currently outstanding questions in the field. These latest news contribute to our current understanding of genome structure, and provide a comprehensive reference for researchers to choose the appropriate method in future application.

	abstract = {In recent years, Hi-C technology has revolutionized cancer research by elucidating the mystery of three-dimensional chromatin organization and its role in gene regulation. This paper explored the impact of Hi-C advancements on cancer research by delving into high-resolution techniques, such as chromatin loops, structural variants, haplotype phasing, and extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Distant regulatory elements interact with their target genes through chromatin loops. Structural variants contribute to the development and progression of cancer. Haplotype phasing is crucial for understanding allele-specific genomic rearrangements and somatic clonal evolution in cancer. The role of ecDNA in driving oncogene amplification and drug resistance in cancer cells has also been revealed. These innovations offer a deeper understanding of cancer biology and the potential for personalized therapies. Despite these advancements, challenges, such as the accurate mapping of repetitive sequences and precise identification of structural variants, persist. Integrating Hi-C with multiomics data is key to overcoming these challenges and comprehensively understanding complex cancer genomes. Thus, Hi-C is a powerful tool for guiding precision medicine in cancer research and treatment.},

Here, we discuss how recently developed computational tools, including machine-learning-based methods and integrative structure-modelling frameworks, have led to a systematic, multiscale delineation of the connections among different scales of 3D genome organization, genomic and epigenomic features, functional nuclear components and genome function. However, approaches that more comprehensively integrate a wide variety of genomic and imaging datasets are still needed to uncover the functional role of 3D genome structure in defining cellular phenotypes in health and disease.},

	abstract = {One common problem in omics data analysis is missing values, which can arise due to various reasons, such as poor tissue quality and insufficient sample volumes. Instead of discarding missing values and related data, imputation approaches offer an alternative means of handling missing data. However, the imputation of missing omics data is a non-trivial task. Difficulties mainly come from high dimensionality, non-linear or non-monotonic relationships within features, technical variations introduced by sampling methods, sample heterogeneity, and the non-random missingness mechanism. Several advanced imputation methods, including deep learning-based methods, have been proposed to address these challenges. Due to its capability of modeling complex patterns and relationships in large and high-dimensional datasets, many researchers have adopted deep learning models to impute missing omics data. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the currently available deep learning-based methods for omics imputation from the perspective of deep generative model architectures such as autoencoder, variational autoencoder, generative adversarial networks, and Transformer, with an emphasis on multi-omics data imputation. In addition, this review also discusses the opportunities that deep learning brings and the challenges that it might face in this field.},
